A larger feature I worked on was a new <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKvNvfwjQT4' target='_blank'>student assignment submission flow</a> that included the ability to save multiple submitted versions and drafts of assignment items. Other responsibilities included <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hbft8jGS-Y' target='_blank'>institutional reports</a>, restructuring and reimplementing the design for the course and admin sections, bug finding and fixing, improving sections on mobile and touch devices, and writing <a href='http://casperjs.org/' target='_blank'>CasperJS</a> FE functional tests.",

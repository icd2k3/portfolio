This is my personal portfolio site and my first project built with AngularJS. Features a grid of cubes that rotate at random intervals to reveal different project screenshots. I'm always game for learning and collaboration so if you have any suggestions about ways I could improve this site please contact me at me@justin-schrader.com.

Notes:
This site is still a work in progress. More fixes and optimizations are on the way.

Tools & Frameworks:
- Yeoman
- Compass
- SASS
- AngularJS
- Angular UI-Router
- Angular Animate
- Angular Sanitize
- Fontcustom
- Modernizr

Conditional Tools & Frameworks:
- jQuery (if browser doesn't support css3 transitions)

TODOS:
- Optimize & re-organize directives & controllers.
- Rework cube animation for IE10/11 (no support for preserve-3d).
- Mobile: rotate cube on project click instead of random interval.
- FB share meta tags.
- Create page for < IE9.
- 404.

This is my personal portfolio site and my first project built with AngularJS. It features a responsive grid of cubes that rotate at random intervals to reveal different project screenshots.

I'm always up for learning and collaboration so if you have any suggestions about ways I could improve this site please contact me at me@justin-schrader.com or commit to this repo. Thanks for checking it out.

Notes:
This site is still a work in progress. More fixes and optimizations are on the way. (see "needs a-fixin" below)

Tools & Frameworks:
- AngularJS (http://angularjs.org/)
- Angular Modules: UI-Router, Animate, and Sanitize
- Yeoman (http://www.yeoman.io)
- Compass (http://compass-style.org)
- SASS (http://sass-lang.com)
- Fontcustom (http://fontcustom.com)
- Modernizr (http://modernizr.com)

Conditional Tools & Frameworks:
- jQuery (if browser doesn't support CSS3 transitions)

Needs a-fixin:
- Bug: cubes dissappear for a short time on occasion if user leaves window/tab, then returns to site.
- Bug: On mobile/tablet there's a sticky scrolling bug that surfaces sometimes.
- Improvement: Rework cube animation to function in IE 10 & 11 (no support for preserve-3d).
- Improvement: Rotate & scale initial item animate in instead of just scale.
- Improvement: On mobile devices, rotate cube on project click instead of random interval.
